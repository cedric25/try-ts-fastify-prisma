# try-ts-fastify-prisma

Some tools I wanted to make work together:
 - TypeScript
 - Fastify
 - Prisma (with a simple `sqlite` file-based DB)

`@prisma/client` imported only once and then injected through to the fastify instance and then to the request. (look for `fruitDao`)

## API endpoints

-> Get all fruits:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/fruits`

-> Create one fruit:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/fruits/create/ananas/yellow`

-> Delete one fruit:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/fruits/delete/ananas`

## Some info

### import alias

I've got an alias pointing to src/ folder.  
tsconfig.json:
`"paths": { "@/*": ["src/*" ] },`

ðŸ‘‰ To make it work when running the compiled JS:  
`npm i module-alias`  
Then import it at the top of your server entry file (`server.ts` for us): `import 'module-alias/register'`

### source-map-support

> In case of an error and when clicking on the guilty file, my IDE brings me to the dist/ folder

ðŸ‘‰ `npm i source-map-support -D`
+ Register it in your package.json dev script: `-r source-map-support/register`

## To Do

- Add ESLint
- Add pino
